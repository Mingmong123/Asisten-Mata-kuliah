# Warning
***Fetch before you Push***<br>
Please update everyone in the LINE group before comitting any push request to an existing file (overwriting)<br>It's also important to fetch and pull before you push. Fetching checks if there are any remote commits that you should incorporate into your local changes.<br><br>
***Pull Request***<br>
before pulling changes from a remote repository in Github, it is a good idea to ***ensure that you have committed all your local changes and pushed them to the remote repository***. If you have uncommitted changes, pulling changes from the remote repository could result in ***merge conflicts***, which can be challenging to resolve. Therefore, it's best to ***commit your changes and push them to the remote repository before pulling changes*** from the repository.
